# ST0001: Arca.Config Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan and progress for modernizing Arca.Config to align with idiomatic, functional Elixir practices and integrate with the Elixir Registry for runtime configuration management.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will be completed in phases, each building upon the previous one:

1. **Foundation**: Establish a proper Application and GenServer architecture
2. **Registry Integration**: Implement Registry-based configuration state
3. **API Enhancement**: Redesign the API for modern functional Elixir
4. **CLI Improvements**: Update CLI to work with the new architecture
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage and documentation

## Phase 1: Foundation (Application Architecture)

### Checkpoints

- [x] Design a proper supervision tree for Arca.Config
- [x] Implement a ConfigServer GenServer for state management
- [x] Set up Application start/stop callbacks
- [x] Create an ETS table for caching configuration values
- [x] Implement basic state management functions

### Implementation Details

We've implemented a proper supervision tree with the following components:

1. **Arca.Config.Supervisor** (`lib/config/supervisor.ex`):
   - Manages the lifecycle of all configuration components
   - Uses a one-for-one supervision strategy for resilience
   - Supervises the Registry, Cache, and Server

2. **Arca.Config.Cache** (`lib/config/cache.ex`):
   - ETS-based cache for fast configuration lookups
   - Implements railway-oriented API with `{:ok, value}` / `{:error, reason}` tuples
   - Provides functions for invalidating specific paths and children

3. **Arca.Config.Server** (`lib/config/server.ex`):
   - GenServer for managing configuration state
   - Handles loading, updating, and persisting configuration
   - Implements caching for efficient reads
   - Integrates with Registry for change notifications
   - Uses functional approach with clear separation of concerns

4. **Arca.Config.Map** (`lib/config/map.ex`):
   - Provides a Map-like interface to configuration
   - Implements Access behavior for bracket notation
   - Adds Map-like operations (get, put, etc.)
   - Wraps the railway-oriented API in a more familiar interface

## Phase 2: Registry Integration

### Checkpoints

- [x] Set up Registry for config key registration
- [x] Implement publisher-subscriber pattern for config changes
- [x] Create subscription/watch API for config keys
- [x] Add notification system for configuration changes
- [x] Test Registry behavior with multiple processes

### Implementation Details

We've implemented Registry integration with the following features:

1. **Registry Setup**:
   - Created a Registry for configuration subscriptions
   - Registry uses `:duplicate` keys to allow multiple subscribers per key
   - Integrated with the supervisor tree for lifecycle management

2. **Subscription API**:
   - Added `subscribe/1` and `unsubscribe/1` functions
   - Support for subscribing to specific configuration keys
   - Message-based notifications for config changes

3. **Change Notifications**:
   - Implemented notification dispatch when config values change
   - Messages include the key path and new value
   - Recursive notification for parent keys when children change

## Phase 3: API Enhancement

### Checkpoints

- [x] Redesign the API to be more functional
- [x] Implement improved error handling
- [ ] Create type validation system
- [x] Add helper functions for common patterns
- [x] Establish key/path module for nested access
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing API

### Implementation Details

We've enhanced the API with the following improvements:

1. **Functional Design**:
   - Used railway-oriented programming with `{:ok, value}` / `{:error, reason}` tuples
   - Implemented clean error propagation
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing API
   - Added Map-like interface for convenience

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error messages with context
   - Consistent error tuples across the API
   - Bang (!) variants that raise exceptions for simpler code

3. **Key Path Handling**:
   - Added support for string, atom, and list key paths
   - Consistent normalization of key paths
   - Efficient nested access implementation

## Phase 4: CLI Improvements

### Checkpoints

- [x] Update the CLI to use the new API
- [x] Add commands for watching config changes
- [ ] Implement configuration import/export
- [ ] Add environment-specific commands
- [ ] Enhance output formatting

### Implementation Details

We've updated the CLI with the following enhancements:

1. **Command Updates**:
   - Updated existing get/set/list commands to use new API
   - Added new watch command for monitoring configuration changes
   - Maintained backwards compatibility with existing command structure

2. **Watch Functionality**:
   - Implemented real-time configuration watching
   - Displays changes to configuration values as they happen
   - Uses the registry-based subscription system

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation

### Checkpoints

- [x] Write comprehensive tests for new modules
- [ ] Update existing tests
- [ ] Create property-based tests for complex behaviors
- [x] Add doctests and examples
- [x] Update module and function documentation
- [ ] Create user guide and examples

### Implementation Details

We've enhanced the testing and documentation:

1. **Module Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive @moduledoc for all new modules
   - Updated main module documentation with examples for both API styles

2. **Function Documentation**:
   - Added detailed @doc for all public functions
   - Included examples, parameters, and return values
   - Documented exceptions and error conditions

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Added unit tests for Server module to verify core functionality
   - Added tests for Cache module to ensure proper caching behavior
   - Created tests for Map interface to validate Map-like access
   - Added specific tests for Registry notification system

## Summary of Changes

We've successfully modernized Arca.Config with:

1. **Improved Architecture**:
   - Proper supervision tree for fault tolerance
   - GenServer-based state management
   - ETS-based caching for performance
   - Registry-based subscription system

2. **Modern API**:
   - Railway-oriented programming for robust error handling
   - Both functional API and Map-like interface
   - Consistent key path handling across the API
   - Comprehensive documentation and tests
   - New "watch" command for monitoring changes

3. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - In-memory caching to reduce file I/O
   - Efficient key lookups
   - Low-overhead subscription mechanism

## Next Steps

1. Implement type validation and schema support
2. Add configuration import/export commands
3. Create environment-specific commands
4. Update remaining tests
5. Create a user guide with examples
