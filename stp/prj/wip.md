## FIXED: Configuration File Integrity Issue

âœ… Fixed critical issue in the Arca.Config.Server module where updating a single key with Arca.Config.put() was overwriting the entire configuration file.

The issue was in the `put_in_nested` function in the `Arca.Config.Server` module. When updating a top-level key, the function was not properly handling the case where the key path contained a single key.

The fix ensures that when updating keys, the existing configuration structure is preserved by properly handling nested maps. This ensures that when updating a key like `llm_client_type`, the entire configuration is preserved, and only that specific key is updated.

A test case was also added to verify this functionality, ensuring that when a top-level key is updated, the rest of the configuration remains intact.

## Context for LLM

This document captures the current state of development on the project. When beginning work with an LLM assistant, start by sharing this document to provide context about what's currently being worked on.

### How to use this document

1. Update the "Current Focus" section with what you're currently working on
2. List active steel threads with their IDs and brief descriptions
3. Keep track of upcoming work items
4. Add any relevant notes that might be helpful for yourself or the LLM

When starting a new steel thread, describe it here first, then ask the LLM to create the appropriate steel thread document using the STP commands.
