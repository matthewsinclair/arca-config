## FIXED: Configuration File Integrity Issue

âœ… Fixed critical issue in the Arca.Config.Server module where updating a single key with Arca.Config.put() was overwriting the entire configuration file.

The issue was that the config file path was cached at startup time, but could be changed by environment variables later. Additionally, we now always read from the current file before making updates to ensure we're starting with the most up-to-date configuration.

Key improvements:

1. Always use the current config file path from LegacyCfg.config_file() when writing updates
2. Read the latest configuration from file before applying updates
3. Create parent directories automatically if they don't exist
4. Refactored code to use idiomatic Elixir pattern matching and multiple function heads

The fix ensures that when updating keys, the existing configuration structure is preserved. This ensures that when updating a key like `llm_client_type`, the entire configuration is preserved, and only that specific key is updated.

A test case confirms this functionality, verifying that when a top-level key is updated, the rest of the configuration remains intact.

## Context for LLM

This document captures the current state of development on the project. When beginning work with an LLM assistant, start by sharing this document to provide context about what's currently being worked on.

### How to use this document

1. Update the "Current Focus" section with what you're currently working on
2. List active steel threads with their IDs and brief descriptions
3. Keep track of upcoming work items
4. Add any relevant notes that might be helpful for yourself or the LLM

When starting a new steel thread, describe it here first, then ask the LLM to create the appropriate steel thread document using the STP commands.
