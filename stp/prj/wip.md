# Work In Progress

## Current Focus

**Completed ST0001: Reconciling Arca.Config with Elixir Registry**

ST0001 has been completed successfully. The implementation includes:

- Integration with Elixir Registry for config change subscriptions
- File watching capability to detect external changes
- Callback system for reacting to configuration changes
- Asynchronous file writes for better performance
- Token-based tracking to avoid notification loops

Comprehensive documentation has been updated in:

- Technical Product Design (`stp/eng/tpd/technical_product_design.md`)
- User Guide (`stp/usr/user_guide.md`)
- Reference Guide (`stp/usr/reference_guide.md`)
- Deployment Guide (`stp/usr/deployment_guide.md`)

An upgrade prompt for dependent projects is available at `stp/prj/st/ST0001_upgrade_prompt.md`.

## Active Steel Threads

No active steel threads at the moment.

## Upcoming Work

- Consider adding encrypted storage options for sensitive configuration data
- Explore adding schema validation for configuration
- Add performance benchmarks for large configuration files
- Investigate more efficient diffing for configuration changes

## Notes

All tests are now passing. The file watcher works correctly and prevents notification loops for self-initiated changes.

## Context for LLM

This document captures the current state of development on the project. When beginning work with an LLM assistant, start by sharing this document to provide context about what's currently being worked on.

### How to use this document

1. Update the "Current Focus" section with what you're currently working on
2. List active steel threads with their IDs and brief descriptions
3. Keep track of upcoming work items
4. Add any relevant notes that might be helpful for yourself or the LLM

When starting a new steel thread, describe it here first, then ask the LLM to create the appropriate steel thread document using the STP commands.
