### Completed ST0001: Arca.Config Registry Integration and File Watching

Successfully completed the implementation of ST0001, which involved reconciling Arca.Config with Elixir Registry and adding several important new features:

**Achievements:**
- Integrated Arca.Config with Elixir Registry for robust change subscriptions
- Implemented file watching capability to detect external changes to config files
- Added a callback registration system for external code to react to config changes
- Implemented asynchronous file writes to avoid blocking the server
- Created a token system to prevent notification loops for self-initiated changes
- Fixed all tests and improved error handling
- Added comprehensive documentation in TPD, user guide, reference guide, and deployment guide
- Created an upgrade prompt for dependent projects

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used Registry's duplicate keys feature to support multiple subscribers to the same key
- Created a separate Registry for callbacks vs. key-specific subscriptions
- Used periodic file checking (with timestamps) rather than file system watchers for greater portability
- Implemented parent-key notifications to ensure proper update propagation
- Made the Cache component more resilient to process failures
- Used railway-oriented programming with `{:ok, result}/{:error, reason}` tuples throughout

**Challenges:**
- Needed to fix test stability issues, particularly with file timestamps
- Had to address a potential infinite recursion in notification system
- Needed to carefully structure process handling in tests
- Had to ensure that the FileWatcher could properly handle token-based tracking

**Next Steps:**
- Consider encrypted storage for sensitive configuration
- Explore schema validation for configuration data
- Add performance benchmarks for large configurations
- Look into more efficient diffing for configuration changes

## Context for LLM

This journal provides a historical record of the project's development. Unlike the WIP document which captures the current state, this journal documents the evolution of the project over time.

### How to use this document

1. Add new entries at the top of the document with the current date
2. Include meaningful titles for activities
3. Describe activities, decisions, challenges, and resolutions
4. When completing steel threads, document key outcomes here
5. Note any significant project direction changes or decisions

This document helps both humans and LLMs understand the narrative arc of the project and the reasoning behind past decisions.
