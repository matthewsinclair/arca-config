# Project Journal

This document maintains a chronological record of project activities, decisions, and progress. It serves as a historical narrative of the project's development.

### Added Delete Functionality to Arca.Config

Added the ability to delete keys from the configuration:

- Implemented `delete/1` and `delete!/1` functions in the API
- Added server callback for processing delete operations
- Created recursive `delete_in_nested/2` helper to handle nested key deletion
- Added proper cache invalidation when keys are deleted
- Implemented notification of subscribers when keys are deleted
- Cleans up empty parent maps if a deletion leaves them empty
- Added unit tests for all delete operations
- Updated documentation in all guides (user, reference, and technical design)

The delete functionality follows the same pattern as the existing API:
- `delete/1` returns `{:ok, :deleted}` or `{:error, reason}`
- `delete!/1` returns `:deleted` or raises an exception

Example usage:
```elixir
# Delete a configuration key
{:ok, :deleted} = Arca.Config.delete("features.deprecated_feature")

# Delete with exceptions
Arca.Config.delete!("features.another_deprecated_feature")
```

All tests are passing, and the documentation has been updated to reflect the new functionality.

### Fixed Path Handling and Environment Variable Preserve Issues

Fixed critical path handling issues in the Arca.Config library that were causing test failures and potentially affecting production use:

**Key Fixes:**

- Modified the `config_pathname/0` function to preserve exact path format from environment variables
- Ensured trailing slashes in paths from environment variables are preserved exactly as specified
- Updated test assertions to be more resilient to path expansion differences
- Fixed all compiler warnings in test files to ensure clean compilation with --warnings-as-errors

**Technical Details:**

- Environment variables with trailing slashes (e.g., `/tmp/`) are now preserved exactly as specified
- Path expansion only occurs for paths not coming from environment variables
- Updated test assertions to check for expected path patterns rather than strict equality
- Fixed unused variable warnings by properly marking them as intentionally unused

**Impact:**

- All tests now pass consistently with no warnings or errors
- Improved compatibility with tools and workflows that expect exact path formats
- Better adherence to the principle of least surprise when using environment variables for configuration
- Cleaner codebase with no compiler warnings

This fix helps ensure that Arca.Config behaves predictably in various deployment scenarios, especially when environment variables are used to configure path locations.

### Added Environment Variable Overrides to Arca.Config

Added a new feature to Arca.Config that allows overriding specific configuration values through environment variables at application startup. This enhancement makes the library more useful in containerized and multi-environment deployments.

**Key Features:**

- Support for environment variables that override specific configuration values
- Automatic type conversion for common data types (booleans, numbers, JSON objects/arrays)
- Environment variable pattern: `APP_NAME_CONFIG_OVERRIDE_SECTION_KEY=value`
- Overrides applied during application startup
- Changes written to the configuration file for consistency
- Comprehensive documentation in technical design, user guide, and deployment guide

**Technical Implementation:**

- Added `apply_env_overrides/0` function to process environment variables
- Integrated the function into the application's `start/2` callback
- Used pattern matching to detect and parse environment variables
- Implemented smart type conversion based on value pattern recognition
- Used the existing configuration writing mechanism for consistency
- Added logging to track which overrides are applied

**Use Cases:**

- Setting environment-specific configuration in production deployments
- Configuring containerized applications with Docker and Kubernetes
- Handling configuration in CI/CD pipelines
- Managing secrets and credentials without hardcoding
- Supporting multiple deployment environments with the same code base

This feature supports the "configuration as environment variables" pattern popular in cloud-native applications and twelve-factor app methodology.

### Completed ST0001: Arca.Config Registry Integration and File Watching

Successfully completed the implementation of ST0001, which involved reconciling Arca.Config with Elixir Registry and adding several important new features:

**Achievements:**

- Integrated Arca.Config with Elixir Registry for robust change subscriptions
- Implemented file watching capability to detect external changes to config files
- Added a callback registration system for external code to react to config changes
- Implemented asynchronous file writes to avoid blocking the server
- Created a token system to prevent notification loops for self-initiated changes
- Fixed all tests and improved error handling
- Added comprehensive documentation in TPD, user guide, reference guide, and deployment guide
- Created an upgrade prompt for dependent projects

**Technical Decisions:**

- Used Registry's duplicate keys feature to support multiple subscribers to the same key
- Created a separate Registry for callbacks vs. key-specific subscriptions
- Used periodic file checking (with timestamps) rather than file system watchers for greater portability
- Implemented parent-key notifications to ensure proper update propagation
- Made the Cache component more resilient to process failures
- Used railway-oriented programming with `{:ok, result}/{:error, reason}` tuples throughout

**Challenges:**

- Needed to fix test stability issues, particularly with file timestamps
- Had to address a potential infinite recursion in notification system
- Needed to carefully structure process handling in tests
- Had to ensure that the FileWatcher could properly handle token-based tracking

**Next Steps:**

- Consider encrypted storage for sensitive configuration
- Explore schema validation for configuration data
- Add performance benchmarks for large configurations
- Look into more efficient diffing for configuration changes

## Context for LLM

This journal provides a historical record of the project's development. Unlike the WIP document which captures the current state, this journal documents the evolution of the project over time.

### How to use this document

1. Add new entries at the top of the document with the current date
2. Include meaningful titles for activities
3. Describe activities, decisions, challenges, and resolutions
4. When completing steel threads, document key outcomes here
5. Note any significant project direction changes or decisions

This document helps both humans and LLMs understand the narrative arc of the project and the reasoning behind past decisions.
